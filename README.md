AuxVision is a system designed to assist the visually impared to navigate in indoor environments. The project consists of 3 major hardware components
1. Self made stereo camera
2. Ultrasonic sensor
3. A computation device
4. An audio headset

### 1.1 How things work
---
- One of the cameras is used for object detection
- The calibrated stereo camera is used for disparity mapping and distance calcuation
- The results are combined and communicated in a meaningful way through the headset

## 2. Getting Started
